## About Me
With six years of experience in property management, I developed leadership and project management skills. I recently transitioned into technology, gaining new skills in JavaScript and React through LaunchCode. 

I am seeking opportunities in software development — either in-office or remote — where I can grow as part of a full stack team.

**Technical Skills**: Java, JavaScript, React, SpringBoot
